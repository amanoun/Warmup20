###Alt Flights
Given a string, return a string made of the chars at indexes 0,1, 4,5, 8,9 ... so "kittens" yields "kien".

### stringAbba
Given two strings, a and b, return the result of putting them together in the order abba, e.g. "Hi" and "Bye" returns "HiByeByeHi".


stringAbba("Hi", "Bye") → "HiByeByeHi"
stringAbba("Yo", "Alice") → "YoAliceAliceYo"
stringAbba("What", "Up") → "WhatUpUpWhat"

### String makeTags 

The web is built with HTML strings like "<i>Yay</i>" which draws Yay as italic text. In this example, the "i" tag makes <i> and </i> which surround the word "Yay". Given tag and word strings, create the HTML string with tags around the word, e.g. "<i>Yay</i>".


makeTags("i", "Yay") → "<i>Yay</i>"
makeTags("i", "Hello") → "<i>Hello</i>"
makeTags("cite", "Yay") → "<cite>Yay</cite>"

### String nonStart 
Given 2 strings, return their concatenation, except omit the first char of each. The strings will be at least length 1.


nonStart("Hello", "There") → "ellohere"
nonStart("java", "code") → "avaode"
nonStart("shotl", "java") → "hotlava"
### String startWord 

Given a string and a second "word" string, we'll say that the word matches the string if it appears at the front of the string, except its first char does not need to match exactly. On a match, return the front of the string, or otherwise return the empty string. So, so with the string "hippo" the word "hi" returns "hi" and "xip" returns "hip". The word will be at least length 1.


startWord("hippo", "hi") → "hi"
startWord("hippo", "xip") → "hip"
startWord("hippo", "i") → "h"
### String deFront 
Given a string, return a version without the first 2 chars. Except keep the first char if it is 'a' and keep the second char if it is 'b'. The string may be any length. Harder than it looks.


deFront("Hello") → "llo"
deFront("java") → "va"
deFront("away") → "aay"

### Logic CigarParty

When squirrels get together for a party, they like to have cigars. A squirrel party is successful when the number of cigars is between 40 and 60, inclusive. Unless it is the weekend, in which case there is no upper bound on the number of cigars. Return true if the party with the given values is successful, or false otherwise.


cigarParty(30, false) → false
cigarParty(50, false) → true
cigarParty(70, true) → true

### Logic specialEleven 

We'll say a number is special if it is a multiple of 11 or if it is one more than a multiple of 11. Return true if the given non-negative number is special. Use the % "mod" operator -- see Introduction to Mod


specialEleven(22) → true
specialEleven(23) → true
specialEleven(24) → false

### Logic fizzString
Given a string str, if the string starts with "f" return "Fizz". If the string ends with "b" return "Buzz". If both the "f" and "b" conditions are true, return "FizzBuzz". In all other cases, return the string unchanged.


fizzString("fig") → "Fizz"
fizzString("dib") → "Buzz"
fizzString("fib") → "FizzBuzz"

### Logic sumLimit 

Given 2 non-negative ints, a and b, return their sum, so long as the sum has the same number of digits as a. If the sum has more digits than a, just return a without b. (Note: one way to compute the number of digits of a non-negative int n is to convert it to a string with String.valueOf(n) and then check the length of the string.)


sumLimit(2, 3) → 5
sumLimit(8, 3) → 8
sumLimit(8, 1) → 9

### Array sum3

Given an array of ints length 3, return the sum of all the elements.


sum3([1, 2, 3]) → 6
sum3([5, 11, 2]) → 18
sum3([7, 0, 0]) → 7

### Array reverse3


Given an array of ints length 3, return a new array with the elements in reverse order, so {1, 2, 3} becomes {3, 2, 1}.


reverse3([1, 2, 3]) → [3, 2, 1]
reverse3([5, 11, 9]) → [9, 11, 5]
reverse3([7, 0, 0]) → [0, 0, 7]
