###Alt Flights
Given a string, return a string made of the chars at indexes 0,1, 4,5, 8,9 ... so "kittens" yields "kien".

### stringAbba
Given two strings, a and b, return the result of putting them together in the order abba, e.g. "Hi" and "Bye" returns "HiByeByeHi".


stringAbba("Hi", "Bye") → "HiByeByeHi"
stringAbba("Yo", "Alice") → "YoAliceAliceYo"
stringAbba("What", "Up") → "WhatUpUpWhat"

### String makeTags 

The web is built with HTML strings like "<i>Yay</i>" which draws Yay as italic text. In this example, the "i" tag makes <i> and </i> which surround the word "Yay". Given tag and word strings, create the HTML string with tags around the word, e.g. "<i>Yay</i>".


makeTags("i", "Yay") → "<i>Yay</i>"
makeTags("i", "Hello") → "<i>Hello</i>"
makeTags("cite", "Yay") → "<cite>Yay</cite>"

### String nonStart 
Given 2 strings, return their concatenation, except omit the first char of each. The strings will be at least length 1.


nonStart("Hello", "There") → "ellohere"
nonStart("java", "code") → "avaode"
nonStart("shotl", "java") → "hotlava"
### String startWord 

Given a string and a second "word" string, we'll say that the word matches the string if it appears at the front of the string, except its first char does not need to match exactly. On a match, return the front of the string, or otherwise return the empty string. So, so with the string "hippo" the word "hi" returns "hi" and "xip" returns "hip". The word will be at least length 1.


startWord("hippo", "hi") → "hi"
startWord("hippo", "xip") → "hip"
startWord("hippo", "i") → "h"
### String deFront 
Given a string, return a version without the first 2 chars. Except keep the first char if it is 'a' and keep the second char if it is 'b'. The string may be any length. Harder than it looks.


deFront("Hello") → "llo"
deFront("java") → "va"
deFront("away") → "aay"

### Logic CigarParty

When squirrels get together for a party, they like to have cigars. A squirrel party is successful when the number of cigars is between 40 and 60, inclusive. Unless it is the weekend, in which case there is no upper bound on the number of cigars. Return true if the party with the given values is successful, or false otherwise.


cigarParty(30, false) → false
cigarParty(50, false) → true
cigarParty(70, true) → true

### Logic specialEleven 

We'll say a number is special if it is a multiple of 11 or if it is one more than a multiple of 11. Return true if the given non-negative number is special. Use the % "mod" operator -- see Introduction to Mod


specialEleven(22) → true
specialEleven(23) → true
specialEleven(24) → false

### Logic fizzString
Given a string str, if the string starts with "f" return "Fizz". If the string ends with "b" return "Buzz". If both the "f" and "b" conditions are true, return "FizzBuzz". In all other cases, return the string unchanged.


fizzString("fig") → "Fizz"
fizzString("dib") → "Buzz"
fizzString("fib") → "FizzBuzz"

### Logic sumLimit 

Given 2 non-negative ints, a and b, return their sum, so long as the sum has the same number of digits as a. If the sum has more digits than a, just return a without b. (Note: one way to compute the number of digits of a non-negative int n is to convert it to a string with String.valueOf(n) and then check the length of the string.)


sumLimit(2, 3) → 5
sumLimit(8, 3) → 8
sumLimit(8, 1) → 9

### Array sum3

Given an array of ints length 3, return the sum of all the elements.


sum3([1, 2, 3]) → 6
sum3([5, 11, 2]) → 18
sum3([7, 0, 0]) → 7

### Array reverse3


Given an array of ints length 3, return a new array with the elements in reverse order, so {1, 2, 3} becomes {3, 2, 1}.


reverse3([1, 2, 3]) → [3, 2, 1]
reverse3([5, 11, 9]) → [9, 11, 5]
reverse3([7, 0, 0]) → [0, 0, 7]


### Array fix23

Given an int array length 3, if there is a 2 in the array immediately followed by a 3, set the 3 element to 0. Return the changed array.


fix23([1, 2, 3]) → [1, 2, 0]
fix23([2, 3, 5]) → [2, 0, 5]
fix23([1, 2, 1]) → [1, 2, 1]

### Array maxTrible

Given an array of ints of odd length, look at the first, last, and middle values in the array and return the largest. The array length will be a least 1.


maxTriple([1, 2, 3]) → 3
maxTriple([1, 5, 3]) → 5
maxTriple([5, 2, 3]) → 5

### Array front11

Given 2 int arrays, a and b, of any length, return a new array with the first element of each array. If either array is length 0, ignore that array.


front11([1, 2, 3], [7, 9, 8]) → [1, 7]
front11([1], [2]) → [1, 2]
front11([1, 7], []) → [1]

### Logic2 makeBricks

We want to make a row of bricks that is goal inches long. We have a number of small bricks (1 inch each) and big bricks (5 inches each). Return true if it is possible to make the goal by choosing from the given bricks. This is a little harder than it looks and can be done without any loops.


makeBricks(3, 1, 8) → true
makeBricks(3, 1, 9) → false
makeBricks(3, 2, 10) → true

### Logic 2 roundSum


For this problem, we'll round an int value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more, so 15 rounds up to 20. Alternately, round down to the previous multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is less than 5, so 12 rounds down to 10. Given 3 ints, a b c, return the sum of their rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper "public int round10(int num) {" and call it 3 times. Write the helper entirely below and at the same indent level as roundSum().


roundSum(16, 17, 18) → 60
roundSum(12, 13, 14) → 30
roundSum(6, 4, 4) → 10


### Logic2 blackJack

Given 2 int values greater than 0, return whichever value is nearest to 21 without going over. Return 0 if they both go over.


blackjack(19, 21) → 21
blackjack(21, 19) → 21
blackjack(19, 22) → 19s

### Logic 2 evenlySpaced 


Given three ints, a b c, one of them is small, one is medium and one is large. Return true if the three values are evenly spaced, so the difference between small and medium is the same as the difference between medium and large.


evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) → true
evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) → true
evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) → false

### String2 EndOther


Given two strings, return true if either of the strings appears at the very end of the other string, ignoring upper/lower case differences (in other words, the computation should not be "case sensitive"). Note: str.toLowerCase() returns the lowercase version of a string.


endOther("Hiabc", "abc") → true
endOther("AbC", "HiaBc") → true
endOther("abc", "abXabc") → true

### String2 BobThere

Return true if the given string contains a "bob" string, but where the middle 'o' char can be any char.


bobThere("abcbob") → true
bobThere("b9b") → true
bobThere("bac") → false

### String2 RepeatFront

Given a string and an int n, return a string made of the first n characters of the string, followed by the first n-1 characters of the string, and so on. You may assume that n is between 0 and the length of the string, inclusive (i.e. n >= 0 and n <= str.length()).


repeatFront("Chocolate", 4) → "ChocChoChC"
repeatFront("Chocolate", 3) → "ChoChC"
repeatFront("Ice Cream", 2) → "IcI"


### String2 GetSandwish

A sandwich is two pieces of bread with something in between. Return the string that is between the first and last appearance of "bread" in the given string, or return the empty string "" if there are not two pieces of bread.


getSandwich("breadjambread") → "jam"
getSandwich("xxbreadjambreadyy") → "jam"
getSandwich("xxbreadyy") → ""


### String2 PlusOut

Given a string and a non-empty word string, return a version of the original String where all chars have been replaced by pluses ("+"), except for appearances of the word string which are preserved unchanged.


plusOut("12xy34", "xy") → "++xy++"
plusOut("12xy34", "1") → "1+++++"
plusOut("12xy34xyabcxy", "xy") → "++xy++xy+++xy"


### String2 WordEnds

Given a string and a non-empty word string, return a string made of each char just before and just after every appearance of the word in the string. Ignore cases where there is no char before or after the word, and a char may be included twice if it is between two words.


wordEnds("abcXY123XYijk", "XY") → "c13i"
wordEnds("XY123XY", "XY") → "13"
wordEnds("XY1XY", "XY") → "11"

### Array2 CountEvens


Return the number of even ints in the given array. Note: the % "mod" operator computes the remainder, e.g. 5 % 2 is 1.


countEvens([2, 1, 2, 3, 4]) → 3
countEvens([2, 2, 0]) → 3
countEvens([1, 3, 5]) → 0

### Array2 sum28


Given an array of ints, return true if the sum of all the 2's in the array is exactly 8.


sum28([2, 3, 2, 2, 4, 2]) → true
sum28([2, 3, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2]) → false
sum28([1, 2, 3, 4]) → false

### Array2 No14

Given an array of ints, return true if it contains no 1's or it contains no 4's.


no14([1, 2, 3]) → true
no14([1, 2, 3, 4]) → false
no14([2, 3, 4]) → true

### Array2 HaveThree

Given an array of ints, return true if the value 3 appears in the array exactly 3 times, and no 3's are next to each other.


haveThree([3, 1, 3, 1, 3]) → true
haveThree([3, 1, 3, 3]) → false
haveThree([3, 4, 3, 3, 4]) → false

### Array 2 ShiftLeft

Return an array that is "left shifted" by one -- so {6, 2, 5, 3} returns {2, 5, 3, 6}. You may modify and return the given array, or return a new array.


shiftLeft([6, 2, 5, 3]) → [2, 5, 3, 6]
shiftLeft([1, 2]) → [2, 1]
shiftLeft([1]) → [1]
